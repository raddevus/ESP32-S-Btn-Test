### Circuit Schematic

Here's the circuit that you can use with your ESP32-S3 on a bread board to test out the push button toggle of the LED.

### Circuit Notes
I added a 150 Ohm resistor to bring the current down on the LED to appropriate levels (5-10mA)

### LED Schematic Reminder
Here's a nice reminder of ways to determine how to hook an LED to positive / negative voltage:
